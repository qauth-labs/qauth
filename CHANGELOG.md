## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: `email` and `email_verified` claims — in ID tokens, userinfo
  responses, **and** the non-standard access-token convenience claims — now
  resolve exclusively from **verified** `user_attributes` rows using the
  ADR-002 trust order (`wallet > oidc_* > self_reported`, expiry-aware). When
  a user has **no verified email attribute, both claims are omitted entirely**
  — never `null`, never present-with-`false`. When `email` is present,
  `email_verified` is always `true`: presence is the verification signal
  (OIDC Core 1.0 §5.1). There is **no compatibility flag** — this is the
  OIDC-correct behavior; the previous always-emit behavior was a documented
  MVP shortcut. ([#229], ADR-002)

  **Migration for operators**: claim emission now depends entirely on
  `user_attributes` rows. Before deploying this release against a database
  that predates the ADR-002 identity backfill (#226) — or whose backfill may
  be partial — run:

  ```bash
  pnpm nx run infra-db:db:backfill-identity -- --refresh
  pnpm nx run infra-db:db:backfill-identity -- --verify-only
  ```

  Both must exit 0. `--verify-only` confirms every user has a
  `(self_reported, email)` attribute row; without it, existing users —
  **including those with a verified email** — silently lose the
  `email`/`email_verified` claims on token, refresh, and userinfo responses.

  **Migration for integrators**: treat `email` as optional everywhere.

  ```js
  // Before — unsafe after this release:
  const { sub, email } = await userinfo(accessToken); // email may be absent!

  // After:
  const { sub, email } = await userinfo(accessToken);
  if (email === undefined) {
    // No verified email on record — collect one, or proceed without.
  }
  ```

  Clients that require an email for account linking should request the
  `email` scope AND handle its absence; an absent claim means QAuth has no
  _verified_ address for that user, not that the user has no address.
