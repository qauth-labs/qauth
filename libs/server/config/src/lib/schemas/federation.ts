/**
 * Federation environment configuration (ADR-004, epic #231).
 *
 * `WALLET_FEDERATION_ENABLED` (#232) gates whether the `'wallet'`
 * `CredentialProvider` (ADR-003) is seeded into the provider registry at
 * bootstrap. It gates an INCOMPLETE epic and must stay OFF until #233–#238
 * have landed:
 *
 * - #233 SIOPv2 authorization request, #234 OID4VP presentation validation,
 *   #235 VC claims normalization, #236 trust registry, #237 `acr` propagation,
 *   #238 account linking.
 * - Until then the registered provider is a skeleton whose `verify()` and
 *   `extractAttributes()` throw by design, so turning this on registers an
 *   inert entry — it cannot authenticate anyone, and it changes no existing
 *   auth flow (nothing resolves `'wallet'` yet). It exists so the flag→registry
 *   wiring is testable before the protocol work exists, not to expose a
 *   half-finished login path.
 *
 * DEFAULT OFF, like every other capability flag in this workspace
 * (cf. `HYBRID_SIGNING_ENABLED` in `crypto.ts`): an operator opts in
 * deliberately, and a deployment that never sets the variable gets the
 * behaviour it had before wallet federation existed.
 *
 * Kept a PLAIN `z.object` — no schema-level `.superRefine()`/`.transform()` —
 * so `apps/auth-server`'s env composition can spread `.shape` (a refined or
 * transformed schema has no `.shape`, which is why `cryptoEnvSchema` has to be
 * parsed separately).
 *
 * @see docs/adr/004-wallet-agnostic-federation.md
