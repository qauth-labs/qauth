# @qauth-labs/server-federation

Federation layer for the QAuth OAuth 2.1 authorization server.

## Overview

QAuth is a **federated identity platform**: upstream identity sources
(email/password, OIDC providers, and — later — Verifiable Credential wallets)
plug in through the `CredentialProvider` interface, while downstream apps receive
only standard OAuth 2.1 access tokens and OIDC ID tokens.

This library defines that abstraction (see
[ADR-003](../../../docs/adr/003-credential-provider-interface.md)):

- **`CredentialProvider`** — the strategy interface every authentication method
  implements. The auth engine resolves a provider by `type`, calls `verify()`,
  and upserts the attributes from `extractAttributes()`; it contains no
  provider-specific logic, so new providers are added without engine changes.
- **`VerifiedIdentity` / `UserAttribute` / `AssuranceLevel`** — the normalized
  types a provider returns.
- **`ProviderRegistry`** — a `type` → `CredentialProvider` lookup, created via
  `createProviderRegistry()` and populated from config/DI at auth-server
  bootstrap.

> **Status:** interface + registry only. No concrete provider ships here —
> `PasswordProvider` (#228) and `WalletProvider` (#232) implement
> `CredentialProvider` in follow-up work.

## Usage

```typescript
import { createProviderRegistry, type CredentialProvider } from '@qauth-labs/server-federation';

// At auth-server bootstrap, seed the registry from the configured providers:
const registry = createProviderRegistry([passwordProvider /*, walletProvider */]);

// The auth engine resolves by type and delegates verification:
const provider: CredentialProvider = registry.resolve('password');
const identity = await provider.verify(input);
```

`register()` and `createProviderRegistry([...])` fail fast with
`ProviderAlreadyRegisteredError` on a duplicate `type`; `resolve()` throws
`ProviderNotRegisteredError` for an unregistered `type`. Both come from
`@qauth-labs/shared-errors`.

## Installation

This library is part of the QAuth monorepo and is automatically available to
other projects within the workspace.
